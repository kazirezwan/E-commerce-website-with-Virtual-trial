## Details
In recent years, there is an increasing demand for online shopping for fashion items. Thus, allowing consumers to <b>try on clothes virtually</b>, which will not only increase their <b>shopping experience</b>, transforming the way people shop for costumes but also save cost for companies. So, our main idea is to create a virtual trial room for the customer which takes a person's image as an input and processes it and gives output where the person's image is fitted with the costume to provide a better idea about how the person will look with a particular cloth. It enables users to try on clothes to check one or more of size, fit or style, but virtually rather than physically. This is done using  3 main techniques:- <br>
<b>1. Pose Estimation<br>
2. Human Parsing<br>
3. Virtual Fitting<br>
</b>

Open the [trial room](https://github.com/bislara/Virtual-Trial-Room/tree/master/Tryy-On)  folder for more details.

Also we have worked on 3D vision and pose estimation using monocamera. For more details open the [Real-Time-Pose-Estimation](https://github.com/bislara/Virtual-Trial-Room/tree/master/Size-Fit/Real-Time-Action-Recognition-with-gui) folder. 

We couldn't upload this to server as our storage requirements for models were more than 2.5GB and also we needed some powerful server, more than which was given in free suscription of AWS/Azure.
